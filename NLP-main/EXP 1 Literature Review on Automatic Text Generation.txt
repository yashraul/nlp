Summary:
Automatic text generation and automatic text summarization are two research areas that have a lot in common. Both areas have the goal of creating a readable and coherent text for a specific user. Many of the research problems are valid in both areas. For example user modeling and discourse structure. In automatic text generation, a computer automatically creates natural language, e.g. English, Chinese, or Greek, from a computational representation. In automatic text summarization, a computer creates automatically an abstract or summary from an original man-made source text. 
The process of explaining in natural language is complex and fascinating. The Speaker needs knowledge of the domain to be explained, knowledge about the Hearer's knowledge of the domain; and knowledge of what the Hearer wants or needs to know so-called user modeling. When a Speaker wants to generate natural language, after considering the three previous points, she has to perform several processes: she has to make a content determination from her abundant knowledge base, plan and organize the information to construct a coherent organization, decide on sentence structure and scope, sentence planning includes also aggregation and finally generate the surface form which involves the realization of the syntactic structures and lexical choice.
